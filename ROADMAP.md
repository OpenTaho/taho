# Taho Roadmap

The following are some rough ideas for features for future versions.

1. All `.tf` filenames have Kebab case
1. Single line attributes are in sorted order
1. Multi line attributes are in sorted order after a single blank line to create a new section
1. Single line Terraform Meta-Arguments are at the top of the block
1. Multi line Terraform Meta-Arguments are after the single line Meta-Arugments in a section seperated by one blank line
